# Autism-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Autism Prediction Using ML | Developed a model using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers to predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) with 93% train accuracy and 82% test accuracy , optimizing with feature selection and evaluation metrics.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects social interactions, communication, and behavior. Early detection is essential for timely intervention. This project applies machine learning techniques to predict ASD based on key features from a dataset.

Key Highlights:

✅ Addressed missing values in the dataset
✅ Identified class imbalance in the target variable
✅ Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and handled outliers
✅ Applied Label Encoding and saved the encoders
✅ Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance classes
✅ Implemented Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers
✅ Performed Hyperparameter Tuning & Cross-Validation
✅ Achieved high accuracy with the best-performing model
