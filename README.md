# Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Autism Spectrum Disorder Prediction Using ML | Developed a model using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers to predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) with 93% train accuracy and 82% test accuracy , optimizing with feature selection and evaluation metrics.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects social interactions, communication, and behavior. Early detection is essential for timely intervention. This project applies machine learning techniques to predict ASD based on key features from a dataset.

## Key Highlights:

- Addressed missing values in the dataset

- Identified class imbalance in the target variable

- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and handled outliers

- Applied Label Encoding and saved the encoders
- Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance classes
- Implemented Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers
- Performed Hyperparameter Tuning & Cross-Validation
- Achieved high accuracy with the best-performing model

## Technologies & Tools Used
